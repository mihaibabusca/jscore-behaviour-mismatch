# Context

This sample project highlights the difference of behaviour in JavaScriptCore between iOS 12.2 and the previous versions.


# Usage

In **ViewController.swift**
1. Uncomment each test and run on simulator 12.2 and lower (e.g. 12.1, 11.3)

2. Observe console output

Note: The collected outputs, during our tests are also added at the bottom of each source file TestException*.swift"

## Notes

The tests have been added to the ViewController in order to allow inspection with the debugger from Safari. 
The tests have been run on iOS Simulators
